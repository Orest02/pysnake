# pysnake
My simple version of the popular snake game, written using.. well, python. 

The snake is represented by a lit of coordinates, which then are changed with eah move of the snake

execute 'prog.py' to start the game.

The snake can go through the screen barriers and appear from the opposite sides, but when it hits its other body parts the game finishes.
